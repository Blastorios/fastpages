# Hi!

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Picture.jpg "Me!")

My name is [Jordi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordi-zwiggelaar-6678b416b/), an MSc student at the VU/UvA (one of the funky joint-degrees that allow me to flex :smile:).

I live in the Netherlands and love everything related to computer-related topics. Being solely limited to my creativity to create: programming allows me to try and push my boundaries.

Yet, computer topics do not tend to satisfy my curious mind. This is where biology/psychology comes into play! I love everything about the concept of evolution and the sheer complexity of biology when you consider the underlying chemistry and physics.

This blog covers a bit of both, combining some Machine Learning topics that either bridge the gap between computers and biology or simply because machine learning is a lot of fun to do.
